  <h4>25 Year Span Data Viz: Energy Consumption From Renewable Sources by Industry</h4>
  <h3>By Becca Thomas Loux</h3>
    <p>This project uses Java Script and three libraries: Datawrapper, D3.js and Plot.ly. The individual charts are interactive and annotated, and display energy usage by source and occupation from the years 1990-2015.</p>
      <p>Bear in mind that this project focuses on ONS energy data from renewable sources only, which is a small percentage of the UK's total annual energy consumption.</p>
